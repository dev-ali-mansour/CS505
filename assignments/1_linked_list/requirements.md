Assignment 1
* Create a template class named LinkedList<T> where T is a type parameter representing the data type of the elements to be stored.
* Define the following private member variables:
* Node<T>* head: A pointer to the head node of the linked list.
* Define the following public member functions:
* LinkedList(): Default constructor to initialize an empty linked list.
* ~LinkedList(): Destructor to deallocate all nodes in the linked list.
* void insertAtBeginning(const T& data): Inserts a new node at the beginning of the list.
* void insertAtEnd(const T& data): Inserts a new node at the end of the list.
* void deleteNode(const T& data): Deletes a node with the given data from the list.
* void printList(): Prints the elements of the linked list.
* bool isEmpty(): Checks if the list is empty.
* int length(): Returns the number of nodes in the list.
* Test your implementation thoroughly with various input scenarios.
  By completing this assignment, you will gain a solid understanding of template-based programming, linked list data structures, and their practical applications.
